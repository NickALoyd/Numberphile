# Numberphile

Basically going to be recreating the problems in numberphile starting from the first videos. Probably going to keep things in python but who knows.

I am going to pass for now. There is no way I am going to beable to solve something that took mathmatic reachers more than a day. Maybe in the future I will make a sudoku solver, and possibly make a sudoku generator that only has one solution. But for now I'm going to pass.  

3/4 and Kleiber's Law

Not really about numbers or how to derive it. I mean technically I can get it but it is going to require looking up calorie information for diffrent animals. Possibly I will have something scrape some data from website that is the best thing I can think of and possibly make an app that gets that infromation and presents it in a pleasing way in a similar veign to scale of the universe. But that isn't a challenge I want to get in right now.
